# Entity Framework 7

Entity Framework 7 (EF7) is an object-relational mapper that enables .NET developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.

Entity Framework 7 is developed by the Entity Framework team in collaboration with a community of open source developers.

## How do I use EF

If you want to use an officially supported Entity Framework release to develop your applications then head to https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/ef6/ where you can find installation information, documentation, tutorials, samples, and videos.

## How do I contribute

There are lots of ways to contribute to the Entity Framework project, including testing out nighty builds, reporting bugs, and contributing code.
